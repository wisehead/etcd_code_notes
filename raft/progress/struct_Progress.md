#1.struct Progress

```go
// Progress represents a follower’s progress in the view of the leader. Leader maintains
// progresses of all followers, and sends entries to the follower based on its progress.
type Progress struct {
	Match, Next uint64
	// State defines how the leader should interact with the follower.
	//
	// When in ProgressStateProbe, leader sends at most one replication message
	// per heartbeat interval. It also probes actual progress of the follower.
	//
	// When in ProgressStateReplicate, leader optimistically increases next
	// to the latest entry sent after sending replication message. This is
	// an optimized state for fast replicating log entries to the follower.
	//
	// When in ProgressStateSnapshot, leader should have sent out snapshot
	// before and stops sending any replication message.
	State ProgressStateType
	// Paused is used in ProgressStateProbe.
	// When Paused is true, raft should pause sending replication message to this peer.
	Paused bool
	// PendingSnapshot is used in ProgressStateSnapshot.
	// If there is a pending snapshot, the pendingSnapshot will be set to the
	// index of the snapshot. If pendingSnapshot is set, the replication process of
	// this Progress will be paused. raft will not resend snapshot until the pending one
	// is reported to be failed.
	PendingSnapshot uint64

	// RecentActive is true if the progress is recently active. Receiving any messages
	// from the corresponding follower indicates the progress is active.
	// RecentActive can be reset to false after an election timeout.
	RecentActive bool

	// inflights is a sliding window for the inflight messages.
	// Each inflight message contains one or more log entries.
	// The max number of entries per message is defined in raft config as MaxSizePerMsg.
	// Thus inflight effectively limits both the number of inflight messages
	// and the bandwidth each Progress can use.
	// When inflights is full, no more message should be sent.
	// When a leader sends out a message, the index of the last
	// entry should be added to inflights. The index MUST be added
	// into inflights in order.
	// When a leader receives a reply, the previous inflights should
	// be freed by calling inflights.freeTo with the index of the last
	// received entry.
	ins *inflights
