#1.interface Node

```go
// Node represents a node in a raft cluster.
type Node interface {
	// Tick increments the internal logical clock for the Node by a single tick. Election
	// timeouts and heartbeat timeouts are in units of ticks.
	Tick()
	// Campaign causes the Node to transition to candidate state and start campaigning to become leader.
	Campaign(ctx context.Context) error
	// Propose proposes that data be appended to the log.
	Propose(ctx context.Context, data []byte) error
	// ProposeConfChange proposes config change.
	// At most one ConfChange can be in the process of going through consensus.
	// Application needs to call ApplyConfChange when applying EntryConfChange type entry.
	ProposeConfChange(ctx context.Context, cc pb.ConfChange) error
	// Step advances the state machine using the given message. ctx.Err() will be returned, if any.
	Step(ctx context.Context, msg pb.Message) error

	// Ready returns a channel that returns the current point-in-time state.
	// Users of the Node must call Advance after retrieving the state returned by Ready.
	//
	// NOTE: No committed entries from the next Ready may be applied until all committed entries
	// and snapshots from the previous one have finished.
	Ready() <-chan Ready

	// Advance notifies the Node that the application has saved progress up to the last Ready.
	// It prepares the node to return the next available Ready.
	//
	// The application should generally call Advance after it applies the entries in last Ready.
	//
	// However, as an optimization, the application may call Advance while it is applying the
	// commands. For example. when the last Ready contains a snapshot, the application might take
	// a long time to apply the snapshot data. To continue receiving Ready without blocking raft
	// progress, it can call Advance before finishing applying the last ready.
	Advance()
	// ApplyConfChange applies config change to the local node.
	// Returns an opaque ConfState protobuf which must be recorded
	// in snapshots. Will never return nil; it returns a pointer only
	// to match MemoryStorage.Compact.
	ApplyConfChange(cc pb.ConfChange) *pb.ConfState

	// TransferLeadership attempts to transfer leadership to the given transferee.
	TransferLeadership(ctx context.Context, lead, transferee uint64)

	// ReadIndex request a read state. The read state will be set in the ready.
	// Read state has a read index. Once the application advances further than the read
	// index, any linearizable read requests issued before the read request can be
	// processed safely. The read state will have the same rctx attached.
	ReadIndex(ctx context.Context, rctx []byte) error

	// Status returns the current status of the raft state machine.
	Status() Status
	// ReportUnreachable reports the given node is not reachable for the last send.
	ReportUnreachable(id uint64)
	// ReportSnapshot reports the status of the sent snapshot.
	ReportSnapshot(id uint64, status SnapshotStatus)
	// Stop performs any necessary termination of the Node.
	Stop()
