#1.struct Ready

```go
// Ready encapsulates the entries and messages that are ready to read,
// be saved to stable storage, committed or sent to other peers.
// All fields in Ready are read-only.
type Ready struct {
	// The current volatile state of a Node.
	// SoftState will be nil if there is no update.
	// It is not required to consume or store SoftState.
	*SoftState

	// The current state of a Node to be saved to stable storage BEFORE
	// Messages are sent.
	// HardState will be equal to empty state if there is no update.
	pb.HardState

	// ReadStates can be used for node to serve linearizable read requests locally
	// when its applied index is greater than the index in ReadState.
	// Note that the readState will be returned when raft receives msgReadIndex.
	// The returned is only valid for the request that requested to read.
	ReadStates []ReadState

	// Entries specifies entries to be saved to stable storage BEFORE
	// Messages are sent.
	Entries []pb.Entry

	// Snapshot specifies the snapshot to be saved to stable storage.
	Snapshot pb.Snapshot

	// CommittedEntries specifies entries to be committed to a
	// store/state-machine. These have previously been committed to stable
	// store.
	CommittedEntries []pb.Entry

	// Messages specifies outbound messages to be sent AFTER Entries are
	// committed to stable storage.
	// If it contains a MsgSnap message, the application MUST report back to raft
	// when the snapshot has been received or has failed by calling ReportSnapshot.
	Messages []pb.Message
