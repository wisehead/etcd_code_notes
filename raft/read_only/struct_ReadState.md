#1.struct ReadState

```go
// ReadState provides state for read only query.
// It's caller's responsibility to call ReadIndex first before getting
// this state from ready, It's also caller's duty to differentiate if this
// state is what it requests through RequestCtx, eg. given a unique id as
// RequestCtx
type ReadState struct {
	Index      uint64
	RequestCtx []byte
}
```
