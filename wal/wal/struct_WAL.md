#1.struct WAL

```go
// WAL is a logical representation of the stable storage.
// WAL is either in read mode or append mode but not both.
// A newly created WAL is in append mode, and ready for appending records.
// A just opened WAL is in read mode, and ready for reading records.
// The WAL will be ready for appending after reading out all the previous records.
type WAL struct {
	dir string // the living directory of the underlay files

	// dirFile is a fd for the wal directory for syncing on Rename
	dirFile *os.File

	metadata []byte           // metadata recorded at the head of each WAL
	state    raftpb.HardState // hardstate recorded at the head of WAL

	start     walpb.Snapshot // snapshot to start reading
	decoder   *decoder       // decoder to decode records
	readClose func() error   // closer for decode reader

	mu      sync.Mutex
	enti    uint64   // index of the last entry saved to the wal
	encoder *encoder // encoder to encode records

	locks []*fileutil.LockedFile // the locked files the WAL holds (the name is increasing)
	fp    *filePipeline
